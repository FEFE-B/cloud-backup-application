# Testing Strategy - Altaro Cloud Backup Software

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Altaro Cloud Backup Software, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

## Overview

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid, with a strong focus on unit tests that are fast, reliable, and provide good coverage, supplemented by integration and end-to-end tests to ensure that all components work together correctly.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components (functions, classes, modules) in isolation. These tests make up the majority of our test suite and provide quick feedback during development.

**Location**: `backend/tests/unit/`

**Key Areas**:
- Models (`tests/unit/models/`)
- Controllers (`tests/unit/controllers/`)
- Utility functions (`tests/unit/utils/`)

**Running Unit Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly. These tests usually involve testing API endpoints and database interactions.

**Location**: `backend/tests/integration/`

**Key Areas**:
- API routes
- Database operations
- Authentication and authorization

**Running Integration Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-End (E2E) tests simulate real user scenarios and test the entire application stack from the API down to the database.

**Location**: `backend/tests/e2e/`

**Key Areas**:
- Complete user workflows
- Admin functionality
- Backup and renewal processes

**Running E2E Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertion library for API testing
- **MongoDB Memory Server**: In-memory MongoDB for testing
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: API mocking for frontend tests

## Test Coverage

We aim for a minimum test coverage of:
- 70% statements
- 60% branches
- 70% functions
- 70% lines

Coverage reports are generated automatically when running:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

The report is saved to the `backend/coverage` directory.

## Mocking Strategy

### External Services

We mock external services to avoid making real API calls during tests:
- Email services
- Cloud storage providers
- Payment gateways

### Database

We use MongoDB Memory Server to create an in-memory database for testing, providing isolation between test runs without requiring an external database instance.

## Testing Backend Components

### Models

Model tests ensure that:
- Documents can be created with valid data
- Validation works correctly for required fields
- Methods and virtual properties function as expected

Example: `tests/unit/models/User.test.js`

### Controllers

Controller tests verify that:
- Correct HTTP status codes are returned
- Expected data is included in responses
- Error handling works properly
- Business logic is correctly implemented

Example: `tests/unit/controllers/auth.controller.test.js`

### Routes

Route tests confirm that:
- Endpoints are accessible with proper authentication
- Request validation is working
- Correct controllers are called with appropriate parameters

Example: `tests/integration/auth.routes.test.js`

### Middleware

Middleware tests check that:
- Authentication and authorization are properly enforced
- Request processing behaves as expected

## Testing Frontend Components

For frontend testing, we have implemented:
- Component tests using React Testing Library (`frontend/src/components/__tests__/`)
- Context API tests to verify state management (`frontend/src/context/__tests__/`)
- Page component tests to verify user interactions (`frontend/src/pages/__tests__/`)
- Form validation and submission tests
- User interaction tests including navigation and button clicks

Examples:
- Layout component test: `frontend/src/components/__tests__/Layout.test.js`
- AuthContext test: `frontend/src/context/__tests__/AuthContext.test.js`
- Backups page test: `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/Backups.test.js`

## Continuous Integration

All tests are run automatically in our CI pipeline:
1. Unit tests run on every commit
2. Integration tests run on pull requests
3. E2E tests run before deployment to staging

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification
3. **Meaningful Assertions**: Test the behavior, not the implementation
4. **Test One Thing**: Each test should verify one specific behavior
5. **Clean Setup/Teardown**: Use beforeEach/afterEach hooks to ensure a clean test environment

## Test Maintenance

As the application evolves:
1. Update tests when requirements change
2. Refactor tests when code is refactored
3. Add new tests for new features
4. Review flaky tests regularly and improve their reliability

## Future Improvements

1. **Frontend Testing Enhancements**:
   - Implement snapshot testing for UI components to catch visual regressions
   - Add visual regression testing using tools like Percy or Chromatic
   - Create end-to-end tests for frontend with Cypress or Playwright

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Implement load testing for critical API endpoints
   - Add performance benchmarks for key user flows
   - Monitor response times for core functionality

3. **Security Testing**:
   - Integrate OWASP ZAP for automated security scanning
   - Implement API fuzzing tests to find vulnerabilities
   - Add tests for common security issues (XSS, CSRF, injection)

4. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Set up synthetic tests to monitor production health
   - Create alerting for test failures in CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement test result analytics to identify flaky tests

5. **Test Automation Improvements**:
   - Create a fully automated testing environment
   - Implement test data generation for complex scenarios
   - Add parallelization for faster test execution
